# Pico-Rubber-Ducky
Code and instructions for making a usb rubber ducky using a raspberry pi pico (or just any other microcontoller that is compatible with circuitpython). 

# Setup Instructions:
Step One: Download circuit python (.uf2 file) for your microcontroller

Step Two: Flash Circuitpython to your microcontroller

Step Three: Download the source code from this github

Step Four: Extract code.py from /pico to the root of your Microcontroller

StepÂ Five: Go to this link: [https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases/tag/20250926 ](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle) and download the latest version

Step Six: Extract lib and requirements folder to the Microcontroller root, overwriting current lib folder if required

Step Seven: Run GUI.py from /configapp and enter instructions

You're all done! You can either unplug your new hacking device or edit code.py to have a custom program.
